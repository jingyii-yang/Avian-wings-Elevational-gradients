Data and code to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript **''Elevational constraints on flight efficiency shape global gradients in avian wing morphology''** (Current Biology).

Dataset 1.xlsx contains the full dataset and the metadata of all variables. The .csv versions of files for use in R scripts are also provided.

The R scripts for reproducing PGLS model results are provided as 1. PGLS global models.R (related to Figure 3) and 2. PGLS elevation band models.R (related to Figure 4).

Code for generating figures and supplementary tables can be found in file 3. Figures and tables.R.

The 100 randomly selected phylogenetic trees necessary for reproducing all model results can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28477148.
